# Russian Roulette
## What is this?
Russian Roulette is a Discord bot, that is meant for, well, Russian Roulette--among other things. What are these aforementioned, "other things," you ask? Other games, some badly written moderation commands, y'know--and that's pretty much it. 

## Can I help?
Hahaha, no.

## Anything else?
No, leave me alone.
