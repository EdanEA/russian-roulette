After you chose your move, the bot chose its own; finally revealing you'd lost. As this was told to, you broke down--the rock which had metaphorically smashed your virtual scissors, in some ways, had smashed you as well. It took all of your hope, all of your dreams--pretty much everything you had, and everything you wanted in one swift motion.`,
